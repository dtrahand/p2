List of Words:
I used this website to dowload a list of words.
http://www.wordfrequency.info/top5000.asp
I used Excel and Word to convert the list into a single column table, with no extra spaces. It was then easy to convert it into an array using the "file()" function. However this function added a space at the end of the words, so I used rtrim() to get rid of those spaces.
There were a few doubles which I found by sorting the list alphabetically, hopefully I got them all out.
